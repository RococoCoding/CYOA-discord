### Summary
The focus of this project was to dive into unfamiliar territory -- I feel like I've gotten too comfortable with our codebase at work, so I wanted to use tech I wasn't familiar with. I'm pretty good at working with code, but can feel lost pretty quickly when using new tools so wanted to stretch those muscles a bit. I chose Postgres because I want to try SQL after having used MongoDB at work, and I had a little exposure to it during bootcamp.
If I'd had more time, I would have done it a little more properly with Typescript and testing, but I wanted this to be as quick and dirty as possible to ensure it got out the door during a long weekend.
